Using file's path to choose the txt file that you want to read and write.
This small program is to encrypt original txt file by SHA-512.
ex : 
Input file's path : C:\Users\user\Desktop\SHA512\testingdata\input01.txt
Output file's path :C:\Users\user\Desktop\SHA512\testingdata\output01.txt
Basically it will output 80 rounds calculation step and the performance (bytes/second)
By the way, the execution file is in the folder called "Debug".
